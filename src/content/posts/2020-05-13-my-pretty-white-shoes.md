**Fall is in the air...It's time for our November Pug Meetup!**\
\
This meetup will be 10-11am at Church Hill Dog Park (Fall Meetup Time).\
\
Social distancing is, of course, required. Don't all huddle in the shelter area, as we normally do for shade. One family at a time through the gate. Be smart and safe please.\
\
Remember to follow all regular dog park rules. Rain date is the following Saturday, same place and time.
