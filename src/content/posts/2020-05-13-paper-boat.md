**RVA Pug-O-Ween is back, baby! And this one is for The Gipper...**

Richmond Pug Meetup invites you to our 11th Annual RVA Pug-O-Ween!!!
This year's event is being held in honor of Wonton, our President Pug who passed away in June. We are calling the event 'Wizards, Witches + Wonton.'

**Event Details:**

* Outside at Main Line Brewery. Live music will be by Heather Grace Evans. Food trucks will be The Heavenly Cove Popup and TIffany's Smokehouse Food Truck.
* To register online for costume contest (you can also register before contest at the event), go to: [https://tinyurl.com/a9vvb7ur.](https://tinyurl.com/a9vvb7ur. "https\://tinyurl.com/a9vvb7ur.") This year our contestants will be wearing numbers!
* Costumes encouraged for pugs but not required - we know not all pugs cooperate with wearing outfits
* Costume contest for Cutest, Funniest, Best Group and new category for this year...Scariest!
* Judging for contest starts at 1:30pm sharp. This year we will be having contestants register before the contest.
* Fastest eater competition will be held after costume contest and will be with a frozen dog treat (all dogs can compete but only a pug can win, no pug mixes - sorry, you know...snout potential!). Winning pug gets a medal.
* Our judge panel will select 4 first place costume winners who will receive a trophy and prize basket. 4 second place winners will be chosen and receive a medal. We will also have a special trophy and winner this year - this will be called Wonton's Winner and will be chosen by RPM organizer, Meg.
* This year's judges are local artist Ed Trask and his daugher, Eleanor.
